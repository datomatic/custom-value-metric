# Custom Value Metric
A custom value metric for Nova. It brings new functionalities to the usual Value Metric, like:
- The ability to link the range dates of a group of metrics so that changing one you would change the ones on the other linked metrics too.
- The ability to show more than one value metric on the same card.
